# Performance Optimizations for Electricity Monitoring App

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to fix frame skip warnings in the Electricity Monitoring App.

## Problem Identified

The application was experiencing frame skip warnings with error messages like:
```
Skipped 49 frames! The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
Skipped 34 frames! The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
Skipped 63 frames!
Skipped 60 frames!
```

The Dashboard screen, in particular, was showing syntax issues in the widget structure that caused unnecessary rebuilds and performance problems. The budget data was being fetched multiple times from different components, causing significant performance issues.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. StreamBuilder Implementation for Reactive UI

StreamBuilder has been implemented for real-time budget data access:

- **Budget Service**: Added `getBudgetStream()` method to provide a unified data source.
  - Created a reactive stream that emits budget updates
  - Provides automatic fallback mechanism for missing budgets
  - Eliminates duplicate data fetching across components

- **Dashboard Screen**: Replaced direct budget service calls with StreamBuilder.
  - Listens to a single budget stream instead of making multiple requests
  - Automatically updates UI when budget data changes
  - Properly handles loading and error states

- **Budget Screen**: Used FutureBuilder to handle budget data loading and processing, avoiding UI blocking during calculations.
  - Created `_fetchBudgetData()` method to handle data loading asynchronously
  - Wrapped the UI in FutureBuilder to show loading states properly
  - Ensures smooth transitions and provides proper loading feedback to users

### 2. Debounce Implementation for Frequent Operations

Implemented debounce pattern in multiple places:

- **Usage Analytics Screen**: Added a debounce timer to prevent rapid consecutive calls when changing periods.
  - Added `_debounceTimer` to limit calls to `_loadAnalyticsData()` when the user changes the period
  - Debouncing ensures that the method is called only once after the user has stopped changing the period for a certain time

- **Dashboard Screen**: Added debounce for data loading operations.
  - Prevents excessive load operations when the screen is rapidly refreshed
  - Improves responsiveness during navigation and refresh actions

### 3. Compute() Implementation for Heavy Operations

Used compute() to move heavy calculations off the main thread:

- **Usage Analytics Screen**: Used compute for data processing in `_processAnalyticsData()`
  - Moved analytical processing to background isolates
  - Prevents UI freezing during complex calculations
  - Takes advantage of multi-core devices for better performance

### 4. Proper Disposal for Memory Management

Added proper disposal code in:

- **Usage Analytics Screen**: Ensured the debounce timer is cancelled in the dispose method
  - Added `_debounceTimer?.cancel()` in the dispose method to prevent memory leaks

- **Dashboard Screen**: Added timer disposal to prevent memory leaks
  - Implemented in the dispose method to ensure proper cleanup of resources

- **All screens**: Added checks for mounted state before updating the UI
  - Added `if (mounted)` checks before calling setState after async operations
  - Prevents errors from updating widgets that are no longer in the widget tree

## Implementation Notes

### Dashboard Screen Implementation

```dart
class _DashboardScreenState extends State<DashboardScreen> {
  bool _isLoading = true;
  String _userName = '';
  Timer? _debounceTimer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadData();
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _debounceTimer?.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }

  Future<void> _loadData() async {
    // Cancel any existing debounce timer
    _debounceTimer?.cancel();
    
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true;
    });
    
    // Use debounce to prevent excessive loading
    _debounceTimer = Timer(const Duration(milliseconds: 300), () async {
      final authService = Provider.of<AuthService>(context, listen: false);
  
      try {
        // Load user data and other resources
        // ...
      } catch (e) {
        debugPrint('Error loading data: $e');
      } finally {
        if (mounted) {
          setState(() {
            _isLoading = false;
          });
        }
      }
    });
  }
  
  // Optimized using StreamBuilder to prevent multiple budget fetches
  Widget _buildCurrentUsageSection() {
    final usageService = Provider.of<UsageRecordService>(context, listen: false);
    final budgetService = Provider.of<BudgetService>(context, listen: false);
    final now = DateTime.now();

    // Get current usage data - can be cached
    final totalKwh = usageService.getTotalKwhForMonth(now.year, now.month);
    final totalCost = usageService.getTotalCostForMonth(now.year, now.month);
    
    return Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      children: [
        const Text(
          'Current Month Usage',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
        const SizedBox(height: 12),
        StreamBuilder<BudgetModel?>(
          stream: budgetService.getBudgetStream(),
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
            }
            
            // Get the current budget from the stream
            final currentBudget = snapshot.data;
            
            // Calculate usage percentages with null safety
            double kwhPercentage = 0;
            double costPercentage = 0;
            
            if (currentBudget != null && currentBudget.maxKwh > 0) {
              kwhPercentage = (totalKwh / currentBudget.maxKwh) * 100;
            }
            
            if (currentBudget != null && currentBudget.maxCost > 0) {
              costPercentage = (totalCost / currentBudget.maxCost) * 100;
            }
            
            return CustomCard(
              child: Column(
                // UI elements properly structured with budget data from stream
                // ...
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

### Budget Screen Implementation

```dart
// Fetch budget data asynchronously
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _fetchBudgetData() async {
  final budgetService = Provider.of<BudgetService>(context, listen: false);
  
  // Get current budgets list and process them
  // ...
  
  return {
    'budgets': budgets,
    'currentBudget': currentBudget,
    'previousBudgets': previousBudgets,
  };
}

Widget _buildBody() {
  return FutureBuilder<Map<String, dynamic>>(
    future: _fetchBudgetData(),
    builder: (context, snapshot) {
      if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
        return const LoadingIndicator(message: 'Processing budget data...');
      }
      
      // Handle data and build UI
      // ...
    }
  );
}
```

### Usage Analytics Screen Implementation

```dart
class _UsageAnalyticsScreenState extends State<UsageAnalyticsScreen> {
  Timer? _debounceTimer;
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _debounceTimer?.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  // Use debounce pattern to avoid excessive reloads
  void _changePeriod(String period) {
    // Cancel existing timer if any
    _debounceTimer?.cancel();
    
    setState(() {
      _selectedPeriod = period;
    });
    
    // Use debounce timer to prevent rapid consecutive calls
    _debounceTimer = Timer(const Duration(milliseconds: 500), () {
      _loadAnalyticsData();
    });
  }
  
  // Data processing for analytics that can run in the background
  static Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _processAnalyticsData(Map<String, dynamic> params) async {
    // Process data in background isolate
    // ...
    return result;
  }
  
  Future<void> _loadAnalyticsData() async {
    // Use compute to move heavy calculations off the main thread
    final result = await compute(_processAnalyticsData, params);
    // Update UI with results
  }
}
```

## Benefits of Optimizations

1. **Smoother UI Experience**: By moving heavy operations off the main thread, the UI remains responsive
2. **Reduced Frame Skips**: Calculations no longer block UI rendering, preventing frame skips
3. **Better Error Handling**: Proper error states in FutureBuilders provide better feedback to users
4. **Improved Memory Management**: Proper disposal of resources prevents memory leaks
5. **Optimized Resource Usage**: Using compute() takes advantage of multiple cores on the device

## Key Fixes for Budget Data Management

The budget data handling had several issues causing performance problems:

1. **Multiple Data Fetches**: Eliminated duplicate budget fetches by implementing a single source of truth with streams
2. **Centralized Data Provider**: Created BudgetProvider class to manage budget data efficiently
3. **Reactive UI Updates**: Used StreamBuilder to update UI only when data changes
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Added proper fallback mechanisms for missing budgets
5. **Efficient Collection Processing**: Optimized Firestore document processing with proper error handling

## Key Fixes for Dashboard Screen

The dashboard_screen.dart file had several syntax issues that were causing performance problems:

1. **Widget Tree Structure Issues**: Fixed nested brackets and closing tags that were causing invalid widget nesting
2. **Debounce Implementation**: Added proper debounce pattern for data loading operations to prevent excessive calculations
3. **Proper Null Checks**: Implemented proper null checks for budget data to prevent errors
4. **Resource Management**: Added proper disposal of timers to prevent memory leaks
5. **Mounted Checks**: Added proper mounted checks before calling setState to prevent errors after async operations
6. **Stream Integration**: Replaced direct budget service calls with StreamBuilder to prevent redundant data fetching

## Budget Stream Implementation

The key optimization was implementing a budget stream in the BudgetService:

```dart
// Get budget as a stream for more efficient updates
Stream<BudgetModel?> getBudgetStream() {
  if (_auth.currentUser == null) {
    return Stream.value(null);
  }
  
  // Return a stream that will emit the current month's budget
  return _firestore
    .collection('users')
    .doc(_auth.currentUser!.uid)
    .collection('budgets')
    .orderBy('month', descending: true)
    .snapshots()
    .map((snapshot) {
      if (snapshot.docs.isEmpty) return null;
      
      // Get current month in format YYYY-MM
      final now = DateTime.now();
      final currentMonth = '${now.year}-${now.month.toString().padLeft(2, '0')}';
      
      // Process budget documents efficiently
      try {
        // First try current month
        final currentBudgetDoc = snapshot.docs.firstWhere(
          (doc) => doc.data()['month'] == currentMonth
        );
        return BudgetModel.fromMap(currentBudgetDoc.data(), currentBudgetDoc.id);
      } catch (e) {
        // Try fallback to previous month
        // ... fallback logic
      }
    });
}
```

## Recommended Additional Optimizations

These optimizations follow Flutter best practices for handling asynchronous operations and heavy calculations. Additional performance improvements could be made by:

1. Implementing pagination for long lists
2. Using const widgets where appropriate
3. Implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data
4. Further optimization of widget rebuilds using more targeted setState calls
5. Adding lazy loading for images and other heavy assets
6. Using SliverLists instead of ListView for better scrolling performance
7. Using SharedPreferences for local caching of budget data
8. Implementing Firebase query caching for offline support
