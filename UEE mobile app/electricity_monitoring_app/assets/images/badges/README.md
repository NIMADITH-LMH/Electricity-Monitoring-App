# Badge Image Requirements

Place your badge images in this directory to be used in the app. The images should be named according to the badge type and milestone.

## Streak Badge Naming Convention

- streak_3.png - 3-day streak badge
- streak_7.png - 7-day streak badge
- streak_30.png - 30-day streak badge

## Image Specifications

- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Style: Use consistent style for all badges

## Default Badge

Include a default_badge.png file as a fallback image for any badges that don't have a specific image.

## Notes

These images will be displayed in the Streak and Badges page of the app.
