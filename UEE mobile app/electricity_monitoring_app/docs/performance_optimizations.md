# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the key performance optimizations implemented in the Electricity Monitoring App to fix frame skip warnings and improve overall performance.

## Issue: Frame Skipping

The app was experiencing frame skip warnings with messages like:

```text
Skipped 34 frames! The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.
```

This was caused by multiple synchronous operations on the main thread, particularly when fetching budget data multiple times.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Reactive Data with StreamBuilder

We replaced direct data fetching with a reactive approach using streams:

- Created a `getBudgetStream()` method in `BudgetService` that returns a Firestore stream
- This prevents multiple redundant fetches of the same data
- The UI now updates automatically when the underlying data changes

**Example:**

```dart
StreamBuilder<BudgetModel?>(
  stream: budgetProvider.getBudgetStream(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
      return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
    }
    final budget = snapshot.data;
    // Build UI with budget data
  }
)
```

### 2. Centralized State Management

We improved state management by:

- Creating a dedicated `BudgetProvider` class that encapsulates all budget-related state
- Implementing proper subscription handling to prevent memory leaks
- Using `Consumer` pattern for efficient widget rebuilds

**Example:**

```dart
Consumer<BudgetProvider>(
  builder: (context, provider, child) {
    if (provider.isLoading) {
      return LoadingIndicator();
    }
    // Build UI with provider.currentBudget
  }
)
```

### 3. Debouncing

We implemented debounce patterns for operations that might be triggered in rapid succession:

- Added debounce timer in the dashboard screen to prevent excessive data loading
- This ensures that rapid UI interactions don't trigger redundant operations

**Example:**

```dart
_debounceTimer?.cancel();
_debounceTimer = Timer(const Duration(milliseconds: 300), () {
  // Perform operation after debounce delay
});
```

### 4. Optimized Firestore Queries

We improved how Firestore queries are constructed:

- Used more efficient ordering and filtering in Firestore queries
- Implemented caching strategies where appropriate
- Added error handling with fallback mechanisms

**Example:**

```dart
_firestore
  .collection('users')
  .doc(_auth.currentUser!.uid)
  .collection('budgets')
  .orderBy('month', descending: true)
  .snapshots()
  .map((snapshot) => /* Transform data */);
```

### 5. Isolates for CPU-intensive Work

For operations that might block the main thread:

- Used the `compute` function for intensive calculations
- Added Isolate support for background processing when needed

## Results

These optimizations should significantly reduce or eliminate frame skip warnings, leading to:

- Smoother UI interactions
- Faster loading times
- Better overall user experience
- Reduced battery consumption

## Future Considerations

Additional optimizations that could be implemented:

- Pagination for large data sets
- Image caching and compression
- Further background processing with Isolates
- Optimized widget rebuilds with const constructors
